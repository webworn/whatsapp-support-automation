- [ ] Validate WHATSAPP_WEBHOOK_SECRET is set

## Implementation Testing

### Phase 1: Configuration Testing
- [ ] Test configuration loading with new variables
- [ ] Verify test mode can be enabled/disabled
- [ ] Check backward compatibility with existing config
- [ ] Validate environment variable precedence

### Phase 2: Backend API Testing
- [ ] Test connection endpoint: `GET /api/test/connection`
- [ ] Test message sending: `POST /api/test/send-message`
- [ ] Test webhook simulation: `POST /api/test/simulate-webhook`
- [ ] Test status endpoint: `GET /api/test/status`
- [ ] Verify all endpoints return proper error handling

### Phase 3: Frontend Integration Testing
- [ ] Access `/dashboard/testing` page loads correctly
- [ ] Test navigation from main dashboard
- [ ] Verify all components render without errors
- [ ] Test responsive design on mobile/desktop
- [ ] Check accessibility compliance

### Phase 4: Message Flow Testing
- [ ] Send test message to webhook endpoint
- [ ] Verify message processing doesn't break existing flow
- [ ] Check AI response generation uses knowledge base
- [ ] Validate conversation storage in database
- [ ] Test message delivery status tracking

## End-to-End Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Message Test
1. [ ] Access dashboard testing page
2. [ ] Check connection status shows "Connected"
3. [ ] Use test interface to send message to Meta test number
4. [ ] Verify message appears in conversation history
5. [ ] Check AI response is generated and sent
6. [ ] Confirm response uses knowledge base content

### Scenario 2: Real WhatsApp Test
1. [ ] Open WhatsApp on your phone
2. [ ] Send message to +1 555 648 5637
3. [ ] Verify webhook receives message
4. [ ] Check message processing in real-time monitor
5. [ ] Confirm AI response sent back to your WhatsApp
6. [ ] Validate conversation tracked in dashboard

### Scenario 3: Multiple Message Conversation
1. [ ] Send initial message from your WhatsApp
2. [ ] Receive AI response
3. [ ] Send follow-up message
4. [ ] Verify conversation context is maintained
5. [ ] Check AI uses previous conversation history
6. [ ] Confirm all messages stored correctly

### Scenario 4: Error Handling Test
1. [ ] Test with invalid phone number format
2. [ ] Test with network timeout simulation
3. [ ] Test with AI service unavailable
4. [ ] Verify graceful error handling
5. [ ] Check fallback responses work correctly

## Performance Testing

### Load Testing
- [ ] Test with multiple simultaneous messages

- [ ] Check response times remain acceptable
- [ ] Monitor resource usage during testing

### Stress Testing
- [ ] Test webhook with malformed data
- [ ] Test with extremely long messages
- [ ] Test rapid message succession
- [ ] Verify system stability under stress

## Security Testing

### Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Test that test endpoints require proper authentication
- [ ] Verify test mode doesn't bypass security measures
- [ ] Check webhook signature validation still works
- [ ] Test rate limiting on test endpoints

### Data Protection
- [ ] Verify test conversations are properly isolated
- [ ] Check no test data leaks to production conversations
- [ ] Test that test mode can be disabled securely
- [ ] Validate no sensitive data exposed in test responses

## Compatibility Testing

### Browser Compatibility
- [ ] Test in Chrome (latest)
- [ ] Test in Firefox (latest)
- [ ] Test in Safari (latest)
- [ ] Test in Edge (latest)
- [ ] Test on mobile browsers

### Device Testing
- [ ] Test on desktop (1920x1080)
- [ ] Test on tablet (768x1024)
- [ ] Test on mobile (375x667)
- [ ] Test on large screens (2560x1440)

## Regression Testing

### Existing Functionality
- [ ] Verify login/logout still works
- [ ] Check dashboard loads correctly
- [ ] Test conversation management unchanged
- [ ] Validate webhook processing unaffected
- [ ] Confirm AI responses still working for production
- [ ] Test document upload/knowledge base unchanged

### API Endpoints
- [ ] Test all existing `/api/auth/*` endpoints
- [ ] Test all existing `/api/conversations/*` endpoints
- [ ] Test all existing `/api/webhooks/*` endpoints
- [ ] Verify `/api/health` still reports correctly

## Post-Implementation Validation

### Production Impact
