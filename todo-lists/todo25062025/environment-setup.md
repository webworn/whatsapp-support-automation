## Verification Steps

### 1. Check Application Health
```bash
curl https://whatsapp-support-automation-production.up.railway.app/api/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "...",
  "service": "WhatsApp AI Railway Template",
  "version": "3.0.0"
}
```

### 2. Check Test Connection
```bash
curl https://whatsapp-support-automation-production.up.railway.app/api/test/connection
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "status": "connected",
    "testMode": true,
    "testNumber": "+15556485637",
    "phoneNumberId": "665397593326012"
  }
}
```

### 3. Check Test Status
```bash
curl https://whatsapp-support-automation-production.up.railway.app/api/test/status
```

### 4. Access Testing Dashboard
Navigate to: https://whatsapp-support-automation-production.up.railway.app/dashboard/testing

Expected:
- âœ… Testing page loads
- âœ… Connection status shows "Connected"
- âœ… Test mode shows "Enabled"
- âœ… Test number displays: +1 555 648 5637
