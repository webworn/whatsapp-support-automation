# WhatsApp Test Number Response Fix - June 26, 2025

## Project Status
**Issue**: WhatsApp AI system not responding to Meta test number `+15556485637`
**Working**: June 19-21, 2025
**Broken**: Since June 22-25, 2025
**Priority**: HIGH - Production functionality broken

## Root Cause Analysis âœ… COMPLETED
- Environment variable configuration mismatch
- Test mode not properly activated
- WhatsApp service using placeholder credentials instead of test credentials
- Webhook verification token mapping issues

## Critical Issues Identified
1. **Environment Variable Mismatch**: `WHATSAPP_TEST_MODE` vs `TEST_MODE_ENABLED`
2. **Credential Routing**: WhatsApp service always uses production env vars
3. **API Connection**: Using placeholder tokens instead of real test credentials
4. **Test Mode Logic**: Not activating due to wrong env var name

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Messages to `+15556485637` receive AI responses
- [ ] Test webhook verification works with Meta
- [ ] End-to-end message flow functional
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved

## Implementation Strategy
1. Fix environment variable configuration
2. Update WhatsApp service for test mode support
3. Validate webhook verification tokens
4. Test complete message flow
5. Deploy and verify with Meta test number

## Timeline
**Start**: June 26, 2025 13:30 UTC
**Target Completion**: June 26, 2025 16:00 UTC
**Total Duration**: ~2.5 hours

## Rollback Plan
- Revert to commit before June 22, 2025 if issues persist
- Backup current configuration before changes
- Test in staging before production deployment
