## Recent Development Activity

### 2025-06-21: Frontend Serving Resolution âœ…
**Issue**: Landing page not displaying correctly in production
**Root Cause**: Controller routing conflicts and Next.js build path issues
**Solution Implemented**:
- Fixed AppController route from `/` to `/api` to prevent conflicts
- Reordered controller registration (FrontendController before AppController)
- Implemented direct HTML serving in `generateLandingPage()` method
- Resolved Docker build issues with frontend directory structure

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app.controller.ts` - Fixed routing conflict
- `src/app.module.ts` - Reordered controller registration
- `src/frontend.controller.ts` - Added complete landing page HTML
- `Dockerfile` - Fixed frontend build and COPY issues
